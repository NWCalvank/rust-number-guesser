# CLI Random Number Guesser

This is a CLI-based number guessing game written in Rust.

It serves no purpose other than to help me learn a bit of Rust, as it's my
first Rust-based project.

Don't expect to be impressed.

### Basic Usage

Supports manually guessing the number yourself or letting the machines do it
for you, which is useful for testing changes.

This makes me realize that I should learn how to write some tests as well.

You can also choose to pick a number between 1 and 10 (default), 100, or 1000.

I may try to figure our how to allow a range from 1 and any other number.
